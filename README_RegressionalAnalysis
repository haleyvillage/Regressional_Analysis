Measuring the Moon’s Orbit
Author: Haley Lorenz
Description: This project delves into the study of the Moon’s orbit as presented in the American Journal of Physics (April 2014), specifically Exercise 3.9 (p. 103). The analysis involves fitting a first-order model to understand the relationship between the angular size (y) of the Moon and its height above the horizon (x), measured in degrees.
Installation: Ensure R is installed on your machine to execute the analysis.
Usage: Run the R script provided to generate the analysis. The data is sourced from a CSV file named `MOON.csv`.
Methodology: The first-order model includes predictors such as height above the horizon. Residuals and predicted values are obtained to assess the model's performance. Additionally, the data set is split into two subsamples based on height, and a test for heteroscedasticity is conducted.
Results: The residual plot reveals a cone shape, indicating a violation of the assumption of constant error variance. Subsequent analysis on subsamples supports this observation, with a BP Test showing significant results (BP = 4.4882, p = 0.03413).

2017 Major League Baseball Runs Analysis
Author: Haley Lorenz
Description: This project conducts a regression analysis on the 2017 Major League Baseball (MLB) runs scored. The model aims to determine the relationship between various baseball statistics and the number of runs scored in the season.
Installation: To run this analysis, you will need R installed on your machine, as well as plyr
Usage: Run the R Markdown file to generate the regression analysis. The data is sourced from a CSV file named `MLBRUNS2017.csv`.
Methodology: The regression model includes the following predictors: walks, singles, doubles, triples, home runs, stolen bases, caught stealing, and strikeouts. The output includes regression coefficients, their significance, confidence intervals, and predictions based on the model.
Results: The least squares regression model provides a prediction equation for the number of runs. It also gives a practical interpretation of the beta estimates, indicating the effect of each statistic on the average number of runs.

Management Research in Africa: Evaluating GDP and Corruption
Author: Haley Lorenz
Description:
This project analyzes the relationship between GDP per capita and the level of corruption in African countries, as well as the influence of political rights on corruption. The study uses simple linear regression analysis to understand these dynamics.
Installation: Ensure R and the 'plyr' library are installed on your machine to execute the analysis.
Usage: The analysis is conducted through an R script that reads data from an 'AFRICA.csv' file. It computes summary statistics, regression coefficients, confidence intervals, and predictive values.
Methodology: The study evaluates GDP per capita and degree of freedom in political rights as predictors of corruption levels. It includes data visualization through scatter plots and regression lines.
Results: Findings suggest a positive correlation between GDP per capita and corruption levels, and a negative relationship between the degree of freedom in political rights and corruption. Predictive analysis estimates corruption levels based on GDP per capita and political rights scores.
